# @paspat/node-red-worx-mower

With this node you can connect to your Worx mower (also supported are mowers from Kress, Landxcape and Ferrex) and receive status messages from the mower or send command to the mower (start / stop / pause mowing).
You have to enter the E-Mail address and password for the account you used to register at the Worx portal.

An example flow can be imported with the import functionality in node-red.
